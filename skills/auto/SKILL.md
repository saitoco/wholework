# Autonomous Execution

Receive an Issue number and run spec (when needed)→code→review→merge→verify in sequence using Size-based routing. Each phase runs via `run-*.sh` using `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` for a fresh context with full permission bypass.

If ARGUMENTS contains `--help`, Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/skill-help.md` and follow the "Processing Steps" section to output help, then stop.

## Route-Phase Matrix

| Route | Target Size | Phase sequence |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| patch (XS/S) | XS, S | `spec (when needed) → code(--patch) → verify` |
| pr (M) | M | `spec (when needed) → code → review(--light) → merge → verify` |
| pr (L) | L | `spec (when needed) → code → review(--full) → merge → verify` |
| XL | XL | Sub-issue dependency graph with parallel execution (spec auto-runs per sub-issue) |

- **Size not set**: default to pr route (safe fallback since AskUserQuestion is unavailable in non-interactive mode)

## Steps

### Step 1: Extract Issue Number

Extract the Issue number from ARGUMENTS. Examples: `ARGUMENTS = "279"` → `NUMBER = 279`; `ARGUMENTS = "279 --patch"` → `NUMBER = 279, ROUTE_FLAG = --patch`

If `--batch` flag is present: collect all consecutive numeric tokens following `--batch`, stopping at any non-numeric token or ARGUMENTS end.

- If exactly 1 numeric token collected (e.g., `ARGUMENTS = "--batch 5"`): record `BATCH_SIZE = 5` (Count mode) and branch to `### Count mode (--batch N)` in the "Batch Mode (--batch)" section (**skip Steps 2–6**)
- If 2 or more numeric tokens collected (e.g., `ARGUMENTS = "--batch 123 124 125"`): record `BATCH_LIST = [123, 124, 125]` (List mode) and branch to `### List mode (--batch N1 N2 ...)` in the "Batch Mode (--batch)" section (**skip Steps 2–6**)

No Issue number needed for batch mode.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/phase-banner.md` and display the start banner with ENTITY_TYPE="issue", ENTITY_NUMBER=$NUMBER, SKILL_NAME="auto".

### Step 2: Route Detection and Base Branch

Detect `--patch`/`--pr`, `--review=full`/`--review=light`, and `--base {branch}` flags from ARGUMENTS.

If `--base {branch}` is present, record as `BASE_BRANCH`. If `--base` is not specified, default to `BASE_BRANCH=main`.

| Flag | Route | Phase sequence |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `--patch` | patch | `code(--patch) → verify` |
| `--pr` | pr | `code → review → merge → verify` |
| `--pr --review=full` | pr | `code → review(--full) → merge → verify` |
| `--pr --review=light` | pr | `code → review(--light) → merge → verify` |
| `--base {branch}` | (no route change) | Specify base branch; propagates to all phases |
| none | auto-detect | Determine route from Size label |

If no flags, fetch Size to auto-detect route:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-issue-size.sh "$NUMBER" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: `phase/ready` Label Check

Fetch labels with `gh issue view $NUMBER --json labels -q '.labels[].name'` and branch based on label state:

- **`phase/ready` label present**: proceed to the next step
- **`phase/issue` label present (no `phase/ready`)**:
  - **Size is XS**: Spec not needed — skip spec and proceed to Step 4
  - Size is `L`: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-spec.sh $NUMBER --opus` (run spec with Opus model)
  - Size is neither XS nor L: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-spec.sh $NUMBER`
  - On spec success, proceed to Step 4
  - On spec failure, go to Step 6 (error report)
- **No `phase/*` labels** (issue triage not done):
  - Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-issue.sh $NUMBER` (issue triage → Size setting/requirement shaping)
  - After success, re-fetch Size (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-issue-size.sh $NUMBER`). Update route if Size is now set.
  - Re-fetch labels: `gh issue view $NUMBER --json labels -q '.labels[].name'`
  - If re-fetched labels have **`phase/ready`**: proceed to Step 4
  - If re-fetched labels have **`phase/issue` (no `phase/ready`)**:
    - **Size is XS**: skip spec, proceed to Step 4
    - Size is `L`: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-spec.sh $NUMBER --opus`
    - Size is neither XS nor L: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-spec.sh $NUMBER`
    - On spec success, proceed to Step 4
    - On spec failure, go to Step 6 (error report)
  - If expected `phase/*` label state is not reached after re-fetch, go to Step 6 (error report)
  - On issue failure, go to Step 6 (error report)

### Step 4: Autonomous Execution (run-*.sh)

Run each phase via `run-*.sh`. Each script launches an independent process with `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` for a fresh context and full permission bypass.

**Execution pattern:**
- Each `run-*.sh` runs as a blocking call (`timeout: 600000`) in sequence
- PR number extraction is run by the parent session with `gh pr list` (included in `allowed-tools`)

---

**XL route: sub-issue dependency graph with parallel execution (`run-auto-sub.sh` checks each sub-issue's `phase/ready` and auto-runs spec if not set):**

1. **Fetch dependency graph**:
   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-sub-issue-graph.sh $NUMBER
   ```
   Parse the result JSON and extract `execution_order` (array of sub-issue numbers per level).

2. **Run levels in order, in parallel**: Process each level in `execution_order` sequentially.

   Run each level's sub-issues in parallel via Bash background (`&`), then wait for all to complete:
   ```
   # For each level (in execution_order order):
   Skip sub-issues that depend on failed issues,
   then run non-skipped sub-issues in background:
     ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-auto-sub.sh $SUB_NUMBER &
   Wait for all processes with `wait`, check each process exit code
   ```

   **After `wait` completes, aggregate-update parent phase** (run after each level completes):
   1. Fetch each sub-issue's current phase label with `gh issue view $SUB_NUMBER --json labels`
   2. Determine parent phase based on aggregation rules:
      - 1+ children at `phase/code` or later (code/review/verify/done) → parent becomes `phase/code`
      - All children at `phase/verify` or later (verify/done) → parent becomes `phase/verify`
      - All children at `phase/done` → handled by close flow judgment (Step 4c); do not aggregate-update here
   3. Update parent with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh-label-transition.sh $NUMBER <aggregated phase>`

   **After aggregate-update, cross-cutting condition pre-verification (best-effort)**:
   When a level completes, proactively check the parent XL Issue's cross-cutting Acceptance Criteria:
   1. Fetch parent Issue body: `gh issue view $NUMBER --json body -q '.body'`
   2. Extract `<!-- verify: ... -->` commands from the Acceptance Criteria sections (pre-merge and post-merge)
   3. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/verify-executor.md` and execute each verify command in full mode
   4. For each FAIL result: output a warning and continue (best-effort cross-cutting condition detection)
      Format: "Warning: cross-cutting condition failed: [condition text]. Run `/verify $NUMBER` to confirm."
   5. Continue to the next level regardless of results (authoritative verification is done by `/verify $NUMBER`)

3. **On failure**:
   - Add failed sub-issue numbers to the failure set
   - In subsequent levels, skip sub-issues that depend on (have `blocked_by` containing) a number in the failure set
   - Continue processing sub-issues that do not depend on failed issues
   - To determine skip: check `blocked_by` in `get-sub-issue-graph.sh` output and mark any sub-issue containing a failed Issue number as skip target

4. **Completion report**: After all levels complete, report results (success/failure/skip) for each sub-issue.

5. **Auto retrospective**: See "Step 4a: Auto Retrospective" section.

---

**patch route XS/S (2 phases):**

1. code phase: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-code.sh $NUMBER --patch [--base {branch}]` via Bash (timeout: 600000)
2. If code fails: go to Step 6
3. **XS only**: transcribe issue retrospective to Spec (see Step 4b)
4. verify phase: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-verify.sh $NUMBER [--base ${BASE_BRANCH}]` via Bash (timeout: 600000)
5. Based on verify result, proceed to Step 5 or Step 6
   - If verify output contains `MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED`: max iterations has been reached; stop chained execution and proceed to Step 5 (human judgment required — do not re-run verify automatically)

**pr route (4 phases):**

Phase transition output format: output `[N/M] phase_name` before each phase, and `[N/M] phase_name → done (details)` after success. Example:
```
[1/4] code
(run-code.sh output)
[1/4] code → done (PR #125)
[2/4] review
...
```

1. Output `[1/4] code`, then run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-code.sh $NUMBER --pr [--base {branch}]` via Bash (timeout: 600000); on success output `[1/4] code → done (PR #N)`
2. If code fails: go to Step 6
3. Extract PR number via client-side filter (handles worktree branch names like `worktree-issue-*`): `gh pr list --json number,headRefName --jq ".[] | select(.headRefName | contains(\"issue-$NUMBER-\")) | .number" | head -1`
4. If PR number cannot be fetched: report error and go to Step 6
5. Output `[2/4] review`, then run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-review.sh $PR_NUMBER [--light|--full]` via Bash (timeout: 600000) (M→`--light`, L→`--full`); on success output `[2/4] review → done`
6. If review fails: go to Step 6
7. Output `[3/4] merge`, then run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-merge.sh $PR_NUMBER` via Bash (timeout: 600000); on success output `[3/4] merge → done`
8. If merge fails: go to Step 6
9. Output `[4/4] verify`, then run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-verify.sh $NUMBER [--base ${BASE_BRANCH}]` via Bash (timeout: 600000); on success output `[4/4] verify → done`
10. Based on verify result, proceed to Step 5 or Step 6
    - If verify output contains `MAX_ITERATIONS_REACHED`: max iterations has been reached; stop chained execution and proceed to Step 5 (human judgment required — do not re-run verify automatically)

### Step 4b: Issue Retrospective Transcription (XS patch route only)

**Skip this step for all routes other than XS patch.**

The XS patch route does not go through the `/spec` phase, so no Spec file exists. To allow the `/verify` improvement proposal pipeline to collect the issue retrospective, create a Spec file and transcribe it using the following steps.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/detect-config-markers.md` and follow the "Processing Steps" section. Retain `SPEC_PATH` for use in subsequent steps.

1. **Check for issue retrospective in Issue comments**:
   - Fetch all Issue comments: `gh issue view "$NUMBER" --json comments -q '.comments[].body'`
   - Search for comments containing a `## Issue Retrospective` section
   - If not found: skip this entire step (no transcription needed if no issue retrospective)

2. **Determine Spec file path**: `$SPEC_PATH/issue-$NUMBER-<short-title>.md`
   - Generate `short-title` as English kebab-case from Issue title (e.g., `xs-patch-retro`)
   - If an existing Spec file is found, use it

3. **Create (or update) Spec file and append issue retrospective**:
   - For new files: include a `# Issue #$NUMBER: $TITLE` heading at the top
   - Append `## Issue Retrospective` section at the end of the Spec file (naturally referenced by `/verify`'s Spec reading)

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add $SPEC_PATH/issue-$NUMBER-*.md
   git commit -s -m "Add issue retrospective for issue #$NUMBER

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4a: Auto Retrospective (XL route only)

**Skip this step for all routes other than XL.**

For XL routes only, create a parent Spec file and record a retrospective of the entire orchestration.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/detect-config-markers.md` and follow the "Processing Steps" section. Retain `SPEC_PATH` for use in subsequent steps.

1. **Determine Spec file path**: `$SPEC_PATH/issue-$NUMBER-<short-title>.md`
   - Generate `short-title` as English kebab-case from Issue title (e.g., `xl-orchestration-retrospective`)
   - If an existing Spec file is found, use it and append `## Auto Retrospective` section

2. **Create (or update) Spec file**:
   ```markdown
   # Issue #$NUMBER: $TITLE

   ## Auto Retrospective

   ### Execution Summary
   | # | Title | Route | Result | Notes |
   |---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
   (list result for each sub-issue)

   ### Parallel Execution Issues
   - (conflicts, race conditions, recovery history. "None" if no issues)

   ### Improvement Proposals
   - (structural issues and fixes. "N/A" if no proposals)
   ```
   - **Result column criteria**: exit code 0 → `SUCCESS`, non-zero exit code → `FAILED (exit code N)`, dependency skip → `SKIPPED (blocked by #X)`
   - **Improvement proposal guidance**: document structural issues from parallel execution (conflicts, PR extraction failures, verify chain FAILs, etc.) and their fixes. `/verify`'s Step 13 reads `### Improvement Proposals` and creates Issues from them

3. **Fetch issue retrospective from Issue comments and transcribe to Spec**:
   - Fetch all Issue comments: `gh issue view "$NUMBER" --json comments -q '.comments[].body'`
   - Search for comments containing `## Issue Retrospective`
   - If found: append `## Issue Retrospective` section at end of Spec file (naturally referenced by `/verify`'s Spec reading)
   - If not found: skip (XL Issues not going through `/issue` may not have this)

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add $SPEC_PATH/issue-$NUMBER-*.md
   git commit -s -m "Add auto retrospective for issue #$NUMBER

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 4c: XL Parent Issue Close Flow (XL route only)

**Skip this step for all routes other than XL.**

Determine the close flow for the parent Issue based on all sub-issue execution results.

1. **Confirm all sub-issues succeeded (`phase/done`)**:
   - If any sub-issue failed or was skipped: skip close flow and leave parent phase as-is (do not close)

2. **If all children are `phase/done`**: check for unchecked (`- [ ]`) conditions in the post-merge section of the parent Issue body:
   - Fetch post-merge section with `gh issue view $NUMBER --json body`
   - Check if any unchecked `- [ ]` conditions remain

3. **No unchecked cross-cutting conditions**: auto-close the parent:
   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh-label-transition.sh $NUMBER done
   gh issue close $NUMBER
   ```

4. **Unchecked cross-cutting conditions remain**: transition to `phase/verify` and post a notification comment:
   ```bash
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/gh-label-transition.sh $NUMBER verify
   gh issue comment $NUMBER --body "All sub-issues are complete. The parent Issue has remaining manual acceptance conditions. Run \`/verify $NUMBER\` after reviewing."
   ```
   Leave the parent Issue open. The user runs `/verify $NUMBER` for final confirmation before closing.

### Step 5: Completion Report

If all phases succeeded, output the completion banner:
```
/auto #N complete
TITLE
URL
```
Followed by a result table (one row per phase with status).

**For XL routes, also output "Auto retrospective recorded in Spec".**

Then read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/next-action-guide.md` and follow the "Processing Steps" section with:
- `SKILL_NAME=auto`
- `ISSUE_NUMBER=$NUMBER`
- `RESULT=success`

### Step 6: On Failure: Stop and Report Error

If any phase exits with a non-zero exit code, stop processing and output the stopped banner:
```
/auto #N stopped at PHASE
TITLE
URL
```
Followed by a result table (one row per phase; use `-` for unexecuted phases).

Do not invoke subsequent phases.

- code phase failure: error in branch creation, implementation, tests, or PR creation
- review phase failure: review wait timeout, fix failure, retry limit reached
- merge phase failure: invalid PR state (not approved, CI failure), conflict resolution failure
- verify phase failure: acceptance condition FAIL, Issue reopened

Then read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/next-action-guide.md` and follow the "Processing Steps" section with:
- `SKILL_NAME=auto`
- `ISSUE_NUMBER=$NUMBER`
- `RESULT=fail`

## Batch Mode (--batch)

When `--batch` is detected in Step 1, process Issues sequentially (skip Steps 2–6).

Two modes:
- **Count mode** (`--batch N`): selects the N most recent XS/S Issues from the backlog
- **List mode** (`--batch N1 N2 ...`): processes the explicitly listed Issues in the user-specified order (任意の Issue 番号を空白区切りで指定)

### Count mode (--batch N)

既存の `--batch N` の挙動は変更せず後方互換で維持する。

#### Fetch Batch Candidates

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label triaged --json number,title,labels,createdAt --limit 200
```

#### Filtering criteria

For each candidate, call `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-issue-size.sh $NUMBER`;
exclude Issues where Size is M, L, or XL (Projects V2 field first, label fallback).

Sort by `createdAt` descending (newest first) and select the top N. Targets: Issues with no Size set, XS, or S.

#### Process Each Issue

Process the selected N Issues **sequentially** (serially):

1. Check Issue labels: `gh issue view $NUMBER --json labels -q '.labels[].name'`
2. **If no `phase/*` labels**: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-issue.sh $NUMBER` (issue triage → Size setting → `phase/ready` assignment)
   - On failure: output a warning and skip to the next Issue (do not abort the entire batch)
3. Re-check Size: call `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-issue-size.sh $NUMBER`; if Size is M, L, or XL: output a warning and skip to the next Issue (do not abort the entire batch)
4. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-auto-sub.sh $NUMBER` (all phases spec→code→review→merge→verify, auto-starting from the current `phase/*` state)
   - On failure: output a warning and skip to the next Issue (do not abort the entire batch)

### List mode (--batch N1 N2 ...)

`BATCH_LIST` に記録された Issue 番号を、ユーザが渡した順序（指定順）で順次処理する（並び替えなし）。

候補取得（Fetch Batch Candidates）および `createdAt` ソートは List mode では行わない。

許容 Size: XS/S/M/L。ユーザが明示指定した以上、その意思は heuristic より強いシグナルのため Size 制限を緩和する。XL のみ例外で、警告を出して当該 Issue を skip し、残りの Issue は継続処理する（XL はサブ Issue 依存グラフによる並列実行経路を持ち、batch の直列処理と噛み合わないため）。

Process each Issue in `BATCH_LIST` in order:

1. Check Issue labels: `gh issue view $NUMBER --json labels -q '.labels[].name'`
2. **If no `phase/*` labels**: run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-issue.sh $NUMBER` (issue triage → Size setting → `phase/ready` assignment)
   - On failure: output a warning and skip to the next Issue (do not abort the entire batch)
3. Re-check Size: call `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/get-issue-size.sh $NUMBER`; if Size is XL: output a warning and skip to the next Issue (do not abort the entire batch)
4. Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-auto-sub.sh $NUMBER` (all phases spec→code→review→merge→verify, auto-starting from the current `phase/*` state)
   - On failure: output a warning and skip to the next Issue (do not abort the entire batch)

### Batch Completion Report

After all Issues are processed, report results (success/skip/failure) for each Issue.

Then read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/modules/next-action-guide.md` and follow the "Processing Steps" section with:
- `SKILL_NAME=auto`
- `RESULT=success`
- (omit `ISSUE_NUMBER` — batch run with multiple issues, guide will be omitted per module logic)

## Notes

- Run after `/issue` is complete (spec is auto-run if not yet complete)
- Detailed logic for each phase (review comment handling, conflict resolution, etc.) is delegated to each skill
- `auto` itself does not post Issue comments (posted individually within each phase)
- Skills are installed via the plugin marketplace and referenced through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` at runtime
