# Orchestration Recovery Log

This file records cross-Issue recovery events, fallback applications, and diagnostics from `/auto` orchestration.

## Purpose and Role Division

**This file (orchestration-recoveries.md):**
- Scope: cross-Issue, persistent
- Role: Append-only log of symptom → recovery → outcome for recurrence detection
- Consumed by: `/audit recoveries` for frequency-based candidate detection

**Spec retrospective (per-Issue `docs/spec/issue-N-*.md`):**
- Scope: per-Issue, disposable (Spec-first principle)
- Role: Implementation-phase record of anomalies and improvement proposals
- These files are not long-term storage for cross-Issue knowledge

## Entry Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC: <symptom-short>

### Context
- Issue #N, phase: <code-pr|code-patch|review|merge|verify>
- Source: <fallback-catalog|recovery-sub-agent|wrapper-anomaly-detector>
- Wrapper: <run-*.sh name>, exit code: <N>
- Log tail: "<last relevant log line>"

### Diagnosis
- <observed state inspection result and root cause hypothesis>

### Recovery Applied
- <catalog anchor (e.g., orchestration-fallbacks.md#anchor) or sub-agent plan excerpt or manual steps>

### Outcome
- <success|partial|failed>

### Improvement Candidate
- <未起票|起票済み #NNN|N/A (resolved by known catalog)>
```

## Field Definitions

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `symptom-short` | Short identifier for the symptom pattern (kebab-case, used for frequency grouping) |
| `Source` | Which mechanism detected and handled this recovery event |
| `Outcome` | `success` = phase completed; `partial` = partial recovery; `failed` = stopped |
| `Improvement Candidate` | `未起票` = not yet filed; `起票済み #NNN` = filed as Issue #NNN; `N/A` = no action needed |

## Sources

| Source | Description | Dependency |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `fallback-catalog` | Known pattern in `orchestration-fallbacks.md` was matched and applied | Available (#315 shipped) |
| `wrapper-anomaly-detector` | `detect-wrapper-anomaly.sh` detected a known failure pattern | Available (#313 shipped) |
| `recovery-sub-agent` | `orchestration-recovery` sub-agent diagnosed unknown failure | Dependent on #316 shipping |
